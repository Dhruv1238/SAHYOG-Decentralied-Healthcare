##SAHYOG - Revolutionising Healthcare in India
**
The Problem:
India, despite having robust identity systems like Aadhar and employment qualifications like PAN, lacks a comprehensive healthcare ecosystem. This absence leaves a significant void in the nation's overall well-being, impacting not just individual health but also the economic landscape. The lack of a streamlined healthcare model in India poses challenges in accessing timely medical advice, leading to delayed treatments, increased health risks, and subsequently, reduced workforce productivity.

Implications on Global GDP:
The absence of a sophisticated healthcare infrastructure affects India's contribution to the global GDP. Without a reliable and efficient healthcare system, the nation faces increased healthcare costs, reduced workforce productivity, and a higher disease burden, ultimately hampering economic growth and global competitiveness.

SAHYOG - Bridging the Gap:
Introducing SAHYOG, a revolutionary healthcare ecosystem that addresses the shortcomings in India's existing healthcare framework. SAHYOG leverages advanced AI models and blockchain technology to provide a seamless experience for users and doctors alike.

How SAHYOG Solves the Problem:
SAHYOG CARD :  Introducing the SAHYOG Card, a unique health identity that is decentralised and easily identifiable. It creates a way to be recognised in a healthcare ecosystem.
Timely Access to Healthcare: SAHYOG enables users to engage in one-on-one sessions with doctors, ensuring prompt access to medical advice and reducing the risk of delayed treatments.
AI-Consoling Assistant: SAHYOG implements an AI model for users to talk about their issues without feeling judged and with the ability to express as much information as they want to a person.
Personalised Health Management: Users can set and manage daily tasks based on personalised health goals, promoting proactive health management and reducing the burden on the healthcare system.
Secure Data Sharing: SAHYOG employs blockchain security and smart contracts to ensure the privacy and security of user data, addressing concerns related to data breaches and unauthorized access.
SOS Button for Emergencies: SAHYOG features an SOS button placed conveniently in the bottom navbar, easily accessible and closest to the thumb. Clicking the SOS button initiates a call to the user's emergency contact (loved ones) and a government helpline.

What SAHYOG Does:
Conversational AI: Users can engage with an AI model for preliminary health assessments and information.
