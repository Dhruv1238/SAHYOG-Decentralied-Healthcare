India, despite its robust identity systems, lacks a comprehensive healthcare ecosystem, leading to challenges in accessing timely medical advice, increased health risks, and reduced workforce productivity. This lack of a streamlined healthcare model also impacts India's contribution to the global GDP, as it results in increased healthcare costs and a higher disease burden.
